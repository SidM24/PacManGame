## How To Play
The aim of Pac-Man is to eat as many pills as possible, without being caught by the ghosts.

If Pac-Man eats a super pill the ghosts will turn frightened and Pac-Man will be able to eat them to gain bonus points. Otherwise, if Pac-Man encounters a ghost he will lose a life.

Beat high scores, and challenge yourself to reach the top of the leaderboard!!
