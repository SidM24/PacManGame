2. Open Visual Studio 2022.

3. Select "Open a project or solution" from the start window.

4. Navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the Pacman game repository and open the solution file (e.g., `pacman.sln`).

5. Once the solution is opened, locate the main file of the program, which is `pacman.cpp`.

6. Ensure that you have OpenGL libraries properly configured in your Visual Studio project. If not, you may need to add them by configuring the project properties.

## How To Play
The aim of Pac-Man is to eat as many pills as possible, without being caught by the ghosts.

If Pac-Man eats a super pill the ghosts will turn frightened and Pac-Man will be able to eat them to gain bonus points. Otherwise, if Pac-Man encounters a ghost he will lose a life.

Beat high scores, and challenge yourself to reach the top of the leaderboard!!
